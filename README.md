Analysis Of Meteorological Data¶:


INTRO:

“Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming” following is the Hypothesis for the analysis.
The Hypothesis means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period. So you are basically resampling your data from hourly to monthly, then comparing the same month over the 10 year period. Support your analysis by appropriate visualizations using matplotlib and / or seaborn library.

Analysis of Meteorological data

Dataset:
(https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset)

The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006-04-01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016-09-09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in the Northern Europe.
Hypothesis to be tested:
Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming
conclusion:
No change in average humidity over the ten years from 2006 to 2016. Increase in average apparent temperature can be seen in the year 2009 then again it dropped in 2010 , then a slight increase in 2011 then a significant drop is observed in 2015 and again it increased in 2016.
Pre requisites:
Python 3 installed
Make sure necessary packages and libraries are installed.
Instructions to run:
First clone the project
Go to the directory where you have cloned it
Run the following:
python weather.py

Conclusion:

As we can analyze there isn’t any change in humidity in past 10 years(2006–2010) for the month of April. where as , temperature increases sharply in 2009 and drops in 2015 for rest of the years there isn’t any sharp change in the temperature.

Note: This conclusion statement is for only month of April , please refer to the model for all the months.
